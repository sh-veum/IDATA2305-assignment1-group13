### Task 2 observation:

Starts process twice and only returns the second start and end times, so the request takes twice as long to complete.

### Task 3 observation:

Can start multiple requests at the same time, processes still start twice.

### How to run code:

Run the main function in you IDE, use postman to send GET request to http://localhost:1234, or use a browser of your choice.
